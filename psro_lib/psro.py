      game: The envionrment.
      oracle: Callable that takes as input: - game - policy - policies played -
        array representing the probability of playing policy i - other kwargs
        and returns a new best response.
      sims_per_entry: Number of simulations to run to estimate each element of
        the game outcome matrix.
      initial_policies: A list of initial policies for each player, from which
        the optimization process will start.
      rectifier: A string indicating the rectifying method. Can be :
              - "" or None: Train against potentially all strategies.
              - "rectified": Train only against strategies beaten by current
                strategy.
      training_strategy_selector: Callable taking (PSROSolver,
        'number_policies_selected') and returning a list of a list of selected
        strategies to train from - this usually means copying weights and
        rectifying with respect to the selected strategy's performance (One list
        entry per player), or string selecting pre-implemented methods.
        String value can be:
              - "probabilistic": randomly selects 'number_policies_selected'
                with probabilities determined by the meta strategies.
              - "rectified": only selects strategies that have nonzero chance of
                being selected.
      meta_strategy_method: String or callable taking a GenPSROSolver object and
        returning two lists ; one list of meta strategies (One list entry per
        player), and one list of joint strategies.
        String value can be:
              - alpharank: AlphaRank distribution on policies.
              - "uniform": Uniform distribution on policies.
              - "nash": Taking nash distribution. Only works for 2 player, 0-sum
                games.
              - "prd": Projected Replicator Dynamics, as described in Lanctot et
                Al.
      sample_from_marginals: A boolean, specifying whether to sample from
        marginal (True) or joint (False) meta-strategy distributions.
      number_policies_selected: Number of policies to return for each player.

      n_noisy_copies: Number of noisy copies of each agent after training. 0 to
        ignore this.
      alpha_noise: lower bound on alpha noise value (Mixture amplitude.)
      beta_noise: lower bound on beta noise value (Softmax temperature.)

        selection.
